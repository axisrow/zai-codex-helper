"""The single provider-apply write pipeline (D-45) — one owner, in the services layer.

Historically this pipeline existed as TWO byte-duplicated copies: ``cli.parser``'s
``_apply_provider_pipeline`` (which also emitted the restart warning) and
``setup``'s ``_apply_provider_inline`` (which did not). They were kept in sync by
hand to dodge a services→cli import cycle, and issue #6 was the direct failure
mode — ``install`` ran both in sequence, writing config.toml twice.

This module is the ONE implementation. It lives in ``services/`` (does IO), depends
only on ``providers`` (pure transforms — a leaf), ``TomlBackend``, ``compute_diff``,
and ``errors`` — never on ``cli`` — so ``setup`` / ``install`` / the ``use`` handlers
all call it with no cycle. It PRINTS nothing and knows nothing about the restart
warning: it returns a :class:`ProviderApplyResult`, and the caller renders (the
warning, the dry-run diff) exactly once from that result.

Pipeline order is load-bearing (D-45): seed-if-missing → backup_once → read →
transform → write_canonical → check_postconditions.
