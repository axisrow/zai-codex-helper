"""``ConfigBackend`` ABC: the uniform mutation surface every file type shares (D-29, D-30).

This is the single IO contract every concrete backend — ``TomlBackend``
(Phase 5), ``YamlBackend`` / ``JsonBackend`` / ``ShellBackend`` /
``PlistBackend`` (Phase 9) — implements. It exposes four operations:
``read`` / ``exists`` / ``write_canonical`` / ``backup_once``. The ABC
resolves its target file through the injected :class:`Paths` (Phase 2,
D-22 frozen), writes through :func:`atomic_write` (Phase 3, CONF-01),
and gates the one-shot backup through :class:`BackupCoordinator`
(D-30 — the single place backup idempotency is enforced, so no backend
can accidentally bypass it).

Why structural delegation:

- :meth:`ConfigBackend.write_canonical` is abstract, but each concrete
  implementation MUST route its canonical bytes through
  :meth:`_write_via_atomic`, the private helper that calls
  ``atomic_write(self._path, content, mode)``. That makes "no backend
  bypasses ``atomic_write``" (D-29) structural rather than conventional.
- :meth:`backup_once` is a CONCRETE method on the ABC that delegates to
  ``BackupCoordinator.backup_once(self._paths, self)``. Every backend
  therefore inherits the sentinel-gated idempotency gate for free
  (D-30) and cannot skip it.

No real file-format logic lives here (D-32): parsing TOML/YAML/JSON is
the job of the concrete backends in later phases. Phase 4 delivers the
ABC plus a test-double (in ``tests/``) that proves it is implementable.
